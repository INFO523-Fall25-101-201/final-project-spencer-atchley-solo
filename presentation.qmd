# Project Overview

## Project Goals
- Which video games should be recommended to a user based on their existing library, playtime, and ratings?
- Which factors (such as genre, platform, or region) most strongly influence a game's global sales performance?

## Tools Used
- Quarto
- Jupyter Notebook
- VSCode
- Generative AI (more on this in later slides)

## Project Writeup
- Full writeup included on project site
- [Project Writeup Link](https://info523-fall25-101-201.github.io/final-project-spencer-atchley-solo/writeup.html)

# Recommendation Engines

## Types of recommendation engines
- Content-based filtering
- Collaborative filtering

## Content-based filtering
- Recommends items to users based off of features and metadata
- Compares item data and user data to create recommendations
  - Item data: Video game genres, time to game completion, cost
  - User data: Previously played genres, game completion %, budget range

## Collaborative filtering
- Groups users based on similarities
- Recommends new items to users based off of similar user items
  - Similar users share similar interests
  - Uses matrices to represent data
  - Measures similarity between users
- Example: User A rated Game1 high, User B rated Game1 high, User A also rated Game2 high, recommend Game2 to User B
- Susceptible to Cold Start problem
  - New users have no past history, system can't perform evaluation

## Hybrid filtering
- Uses both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering
- Helps to overcome weaknesses from models, such as cold start problem

## Project Choice
- Collaborative filtering chosen for project
  - Easier to use as introduction to recommendation engines
  - Good support using available Python libraries
  - Good learning opportunity, easier to understand

# Tools and Libraries

## Surprise
- Simple Python RecommendatIon System Engine
- Collaborative filtering library
- Well documented, easy to use

## Other libraries used
- Standard libraries used throughout course
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - seaborn

# Data sets

## Video Game Sales
- Thousands of video game sales
- Various pieces of metadata
  - Ranking of overall sales
  - Platform
  - Year of release
  - Regional sales and global sales

## Video Game Reviews and Ratings
- Seemed promising at initial glance
- EDA determined not feasible for project
  - Randomly generated data

# Use of Generative AI

## Agentic AI
- How can we use Agentic AI to assist in data science?
  - Wanted to explore the use of agentic AI in a practical development setting
- Used OpenAI Codex
  - Extension for VSCode
  - Used GPT-5.1-Codex-Max model
- Thorough review required
  - Code review needed on each generated line

# Development Workflow

## Synthetic Dataset Generation
- Needed synthetic player data
  - Needed both unique player entities and game ratings
- Agentic AI used for player_gen script
- Several attempts and some refinement required

## Jupyter Notebook
- Common tool for data science workflows
- Used for exploratory data analysis and recommendation engine

# Code Disclaimer

## Disclaimer
- Not all code and EDA is included in this presentation
- See Jupyter Notebook file `notebooks/final.ipynb` for full context

# Exploring the Players dataset

## Inspecting the dataframe
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
# Looking at the players dataset.
players.info()
```

## Describing the dataframe
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
players.describe()
```

## Examining the age groups
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
# How many players are in each age group?
players['age_group'].value_counts()
```

## Average session count and session length per age group
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
# Based off of age group, what are some statistics for number of sessions per week and average session length?
players.groupby('age_group')[['session_count_per_week', 'avg_session_length_hours']].agg(['mean','median','min','max'])
```

## Sessions per Week
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| fig.width: 5.5
# Looking at the distribution of session counts and average session lengths.
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5.5, 5.5 * 0.4))
ax.set_xlabel("Session Count per Week")
sns.histplot(players['session_count_per_week'], kde=True, ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout()
```

## Average Session Length In Hours
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| fig.width: 5.5
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5.5, 5.5 * 0.4))
ax.set_xlabel("Average Session Length (hrs)")
sns.histplot(players['avg_session_length_hours'], kde=True, ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout() 
```

# Player Ratings

# Using Quarto for presentations

## Quarto

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Layouts

You can use plain text

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns
:::
:::::

[^1]: And add footnotes

-   like

-   this

## Code

## Plots

```{python}
# penguins['species'] = penguins['species'].apply(lambda x: "Adelie" if x == "Adelie" else "Other")
# sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x='flipper_length_mm', y='body_mass_g', hue='species')
# plt.show()
```

## Plot and text

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text

-   goes here
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{python}
#| warning: false
#| fig.width: 5.5
# fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5.5, 5.5 * 0.618))
# sns.boxplot(data=penguins, x='bill_length_mm', y='species', hue='species', ax=ax)
# plt.show()
```
:::
:::::

# A new section...

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{python}
# penguins.head().to_html()
```

## Images

![Image credit: Danielle Navarro, Percolate.](images/watercolour_sys02_img34_teacup-ocean.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
