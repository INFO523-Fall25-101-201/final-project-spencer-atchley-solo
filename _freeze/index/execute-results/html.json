Using the Surprise library for collaborative filtering, a synthetic dataset of player ratings, and the vgsales dataset for context, the project demonstrates how user–item interactions can drive effective recommendations while also examining broader trends in video game sales, such as genre performance, publisher dominance, and regional market differences.\n\n",
