Video Game Sales\n  - Rank\n    - Ranking of overall sales\n  - Name\n    - The games name\n  - Platform\n    - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)\n  - Year\n    - Year of the game's release\n  - Genre\n    - Genre of the game\n  - Publisher\n    - Publisher of the game\n  - NA_Sales\n    - Sales in North America (in millions)\n  - EU_Sales\n    - Sales in Europe (in millions)\n  - JP_Sales\n    - Sales in Japan (in millions)\n  - Other_Sales\n    - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)\n  - Global_Sales\n    - Total worldwide sales.\n\n2. Video Game Reviews and Ratings\n  - Game Title\n    - The name of the video game (e.g., Super Mario Odyssey, FIFA 24)\n  - User Rating\n    - A numerical rating given by the user, ranging from 0 to 10, indicating their overall satisfaction with the game.\n  - Age Group Target\n    - The primary demographic that the game is designed for (e.g., Kids, Teens, Adults, All Ages).\n  - Price\n    - The retail price of the game (in USD), reflecting its market value at the time of purchase.\n  - Platform\n    - The gaming platform(s) on which the game is available (e.g., PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Mobile).\n  - Requires Special Device\n    - Whether the game requires special hardware or accessories\n  - Developer\n    - The company or studio responsible for developing the game (e.g., Nintendo, EA Sports, Epic Games).\n  - Publisher\n    - The company that publishes the game (e.g., Activision, Take-Two Interactive, Square Enix).\n  - Release Year\n    - The year the game was released to the public.\n  - Genre\n    - The category of gameplay the game falls under (e.g., Action, Adventure, Sports, Puzzle, RPG).\n\n3. User (synthetic data)\n  - UserId\n    - Unique identifier assigned to each user\n  - Username\n    - Fictional username or handle representing the player. Sometimes known as a \"gamertag\"\n  - Age\n    - The user’s age in years; allows demographic-based analysis (e.g., age-related genre preferences).\n  - Gender\n    - The gender of the user\n  - Country\n    - The country or region where the user resides; aligns with regional sales data such as NA_Sales or EU_Sales.\n  - PlatformsOwned\n    - The gaming platform(s) that the user owns\n  - AvgPlaytimePerWeek\n    - The average number of hours the user spends gaming each week; indicates engagement intensity and likelihood of interaction with new titles.\n  - FavoriteGenres\n    - The top 1–3 game genres the user most enjoys (e.g., RPG, Action, Sports)\n  - PriceSensitivity\n    - Represents the user’s sensitivity to price (Low, Medium, High)\n  - HasSpecialHardware\n    - Indicates whether the user owns specialized hardware (e.g., VR headset, motion controller)\n  - GamesOwned\n    - A list of titles currently owned by the user\n  - PlaytimeByGame\n    - A mapping of each owned game to the number of hours played\n  - UserRatings\n    - A mapping of each owned game to a user-assigned rating (0–10); enables collaborative filtering based on user-item relationships.\n  - SessionFrequency\n    - Number of gaming sessions per week; helps model user engagement and recommendation responsiveness.\n\n## Questions\n\nWhich video games should be recommended to a user based on their existing library, playtime, and ratings?\n\nWhat factors (such as genre, platform, or region) most strongly influence a game’s global sales performance?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n1. Video Game Recommender\n- Variables Used: User’s games, playtime, ratings, favorite genres, and platforms.\n- New Data to Create: Average playtime and ratings by genre for each user.\n- Extra Data Needed: None, all data comes from the current datasets.\n\n2. Which factors influence a game's global sales performance?\n- Variables Used: Global sales, genre, platform, release year, publisher, and user rating.\n- New Data to Create: Average sales by genre and platform.\n- Extra Data Needed: None, only existing sales and reviews data are used.\n\n",
