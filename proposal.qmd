# Showcasing an example script of how I might generate the synthetic data for users.
# I could also just use GenAI to generate a dataset.

# First, loading in the unique platforms and game_titles from the sales dataframe.
# In the actual project I will merge sales and reviews to get a more complete list of games that exist in both dataframes.
platforms = sales_df["Platform"].unique().tolist()
game_titles = sales_df["Name"].unique().tolist()

# Helper data for random generation
# For genre, I'll eventually determine the user's favorite genres based off of the highest frequency of genres the user has played. For now this will suffice.
genres = ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Shooter", "Sports", "Puzzle"]
countries = ["USA", "Canada", "UK", "Germany", "Japan", "Australia"]

There are three primary data sets that will be used as part of this project:

1.  Video Game Sales

-   Rank
    -   Ranking of overall sales
-   Name
    -   The games name
-   Platform
    -   Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)

-   Publisher
    -   Publisher of the game
-   NA_Sales
    -   Sales in North America (in millions)
-   EU_Sales
    -   Sales in Europe (in millions)
-   JP_Sales
    -   Sales in Japan (in millions)
-   Other_Sales
    -   Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)
-   Global_Sales
    -   Total worldwide sales.

2.  Video Game Reviews and Ratings

-   Game Title
    -   The name of the video game (e.g., Super Mario Odyssey, FIFA 24)

3.  User (synthetic data)

-   UserId
    -   Unique identifier assigned to each user
-   Username
    -   Fictional username or handle representing the player. Sometimes known as a "gamertag"

## Questions

Which video games should be recommended to a user based on their existing library, playtime, and ratings?

What factors (such as genre, platform, or region) most strongly influence a game’s global sales performance?

## Analysis plan

1.  Video Game Recommender

-   Variables Used: User’s games, playtime, ratings, favorite genres, and platforms.
-   New Data to Create: Average playtime and ratings by genre for each user.
-   Extra Data Needed: None, all data comes from the current datasets.

2.  Which factors influence a game's global sales performance?

-   Variables Used: Global sales, genre, platform, release year, publisher, and user rating.
-   New Data to Create: Average sales by genre and platform.
-   Extra Data Needed: None, only existing sales and reviews data are used.
